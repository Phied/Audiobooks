Only the handles were showing. Richard saw, too, the broken end of a sword blade jutting out from the center of the man's chest. The point of that same blade stuck out from the man’s back. </p> <p>\"Richard recognized the knife handles. All three were the style carried by the men of the First File. </p> <p>\"He looked from those blades that should have killed the big man, up to his face. That was when he realized the true horror of the situation, and the reason for the unbearable stench of death.\" </p> <p>Sequel to the #1 <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Omen Machine</i>.</p>";
