Now the barrier has been breached, and the New World is again beset by their evil power.</p> <p>War and treachery plague the world, and only Richard and Kahlan can save it from an armageddon of unimaginable savagery and destruction.</p> <p>In <i>Blood of the Fold</i>, Terry Goodkind, author of the brilliant bestsellers <i>Wizard's First Rule </i>and <i>Stone of Tears</i>, has created his most masterful epic yet, a sumptuous feast of magic and excitement replete with the wonders of his unique fantasy vision.</p>";
